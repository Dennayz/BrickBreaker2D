# BrickBreaker2D

Built a Brick Breaker Game to practice Java Swing and OOP Design. Needed to present a Final project for School so I decided to practice building games using Java to further prepare.

# HOW TO PLAY

- jar file in out/artifacts/
- make sure to import the javazoom jar file 
- can play with A & D keys or LEFT & RIGHT arrow keys to move paddle around

# LEARNING EXPERIENCE

- Implemented mp3 music files
- Implemented animated ImageIcons files
- Java Swing and awt tool kits
- How JLabel, JPanel and JLayeredPane works, because I struggled so hard to understand how to layer each Panel ontop of each other, but then I realized you needed JLabels to do that and use a main JLayeredPane to add Labels and then use the main Frame to add the JLayeredPanel onto The main JFrame
